Hi all 👋 , we're excited to go live with this audit contest for the new multi-chain product of the Centrifuge protocol!

We're working hard to build an ecosystem for onchain credit, to enable a radically faster, more cost-effective, and fully-transparent model for connecting investors and borrowers with bankless liquidity, and making sure we do that safely is obviously critical! So really appreciate collaborating with you all on this in the next 6 days.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask here or reach out to me, @ilinz or @Stoxophone. I'm based in the CET timezone so will mostly be responsive during those times, but will try to be as available as I can.

Some parts of it will be outdated. There's not much details yet on Liquidity Pools specifically,  which is why we tried to add as much detail as possible to the README. But the high level docs in that link about how Centrifuge pools work are definitely up to date and should help to give a good understanding of the protocol!

1) This is the first audit
2) Pools on Centrifuge is live but Liquidity Pools is not. Those docs linked above (https://docs.centrifuge.io/learn/terms/) are for Centrifuge pools, but the scope of this audit is just Liquidity Pools, which will enable interacting with these centrifuge pools from various L1s and L2s. The audit page has more information on what Liquidity Pools is and whats in scope

@hieronx    Rebase and fee-on-transfer tokens are not supported.       is out of scope   what does it mean  ?


[09/09/2023 08:02] hieronx
ERC20 tokens that have rebasing logic (which change supply based on price differences) and fee-on-transfer logic (which the actual transferred balance is slightly less because of a fee) will never be added through `addCurrency`, and are thus not supported. If they would be added, some of the logic in the investment mgr wouldn't work correctly as it expects the balance to be static.

[09/09/2023 08:43] albertwh1te
I believe continuous lines signify a function call


[09/09/2023 09:22] thekmj
~~Realistically `Root.relyContract()` and `Root.denyContract()` are not ever called right? Because in a proper setup, the only ward for `Root` are `PauseAdmin` and `DelayedAdmin`, and it's impossible for those two contracts to call those two functions. The `Root` itself should also have no EOA/multisig admins~~

Solved, this is for emergency scenarios where the team has to step in (e.g. removing a compromised router). The `DelayedAdmin` will make a trusted EOA be an admin of the `Root`, then the EOA will act accordingly.


[09/09/2023 09:25] catscanaudit
If I understood correctly, from a high level perspective, Investors use stablecoins to generate CFG tokens from the LP, then use CFG to invest in different tiered Tranches which are generated for an RWA Pool. Then the profit from those Tranches is returned back to the investor in Tranch Tokens per epochs? @hieronx


[09/09/2023 09:30] catscanaudit
After another read in the documentation I think the Tranch Tokens are given to the investor and represent "interests" in the tranches, so does that mean a fraction of the yield


[09/09/2023 09:44] catscanaudit
Are tranches ERC4626 or only the LP?

I should have clarified that in the README. The idea is that continuous lines are `ward` s that are used for the day-to-day functioning of the protocol, while the dashed lines are used for `ward`s that the `Root` contract has just for emergency scenarios.

CFG tokens are not used for pools.

Investors use stablecoins to submit deposit requests to the liquidity pools. If the deposit requests are executed, then they get tranche tokens, which represent shares of the tranches of the RWA pool.

The profit of the tranches is returned through an increase in the price of the tranche tokens. So if the price changed from 1.0 to 1.2 during your investment, you can redeem and will get 20% more stablecoins back than you initially deposited.


[09/09/2023 10:11] hieronx
> Are tranches ERC4626 or only the LP?
The Liquidity Pool contract is an extension of ERC4626. There can be multiple Liquidity Pools per tranche, 1 per currency that is invested with.

> @hieronx Can you explain the roles of the Admins, I supposed the hierachy is as follow Root->DelayedAdmin->PauseAdmin 
`Root` is a single smart contract that is a ward on all other contracts, and acts therefore as kind of a "root admin account". But no one directly controls this. Instead, there is the `PauseAdmin` and `DelayedAdmin` that each control parts of `Root`.

The `PauseAdmin` can instantaneously pause the protocol. The `DelayedAdmin` can make itself or another contract (that could be a migration, similar to the MakerDAO spell pattern: https://collateral.makerdao.com/smart-contracts-domain/collateral-onboarding-spell-crafting-guide) ward on any contract through `Root.scheduleRely` and then once it is relied, `Root.relyContract`.


[09/09/2023 12:15] mrosas
What do y mean by no one directly control the root admin acc


[09/09/2023 12:15] hieronx
There should be no EOA that's a `ward` on the `Root` contract


[09/09/2023 12:15] hieronx
Like no multisig or individual wallet that is a ward on the `Root`


[09/09/2023 12:16] hieronx
Only other smart contracts (specifically, `PauseAdmin` and `DelayedAdmin`)

"There can be multiple Liquidity Pools per tranche, 1 per currency that is invested with." 

So, that means that the relationship between Liquidity Pools and Tranches is many to 1 (Multiple Liquidity Pools to 1 tranche)?

From the User Flows diagram in the readme, I thought the relationship was 1 to many (1 Liquidity Pool to many tranches), but maybe I understood it wrong.... 

@hieronx , Can you confirm what's the relationship between Liquidity Pools and Tranches?

Wait i thought the relationship is multiple liquidity pools (tranches) to a single RWA centrifuge pool

{Reactions}
🤔 

[09/09/2023 21:24] 0xnevi
A tranche refers to a separate deployment of LP + their respective currency (asset) + tranche token (shares)

The only caveat here is that different LP with difference currency (asset) can be linked to the same tranche token (shares) which is then linked to the centrifuge RWA pool

TLDR LP is the Tranche itself, correct me if im wrong ofc so tranchID --> refers to Id for LP, poolId --> refers to Id of RWA centrifuge pool

@Stoxophone So the Liquidity Pools are actually more like a Vault right?
Investors deposit the allowed currency and receive shares, which in this case, the shares of different Liquidity Pools will be the same (if the LP contract belongs to the same tranch) ERC20 right?


[09/09/2023 22:48] 0xstalin
I mean that Liquidity Pools are more like a Vault because there is not a Liquidity Provider adding one token to give in exchange for the deposited asset


[09/09/2023 22:50] 0xstalin
Is just, investor deposit assets and receive an equivalent number of shares representing the amount of deposited assets, but there is no other entity supplying those emitted shares, right?

question that has just come to my mind unrelated to the current topic 🙂

The protocol will be multichain right? meaning, the contracts can be deployed on different chains, but, the crosschain message will be only between 1 chain and the Centrifuge chain?

Meaning, if contracts are deployed on Ethereum and Arbitrum, the two chains won't talk to each other, only Ethereum to/from Centrifuge and Arbitrum to/from Centrifuge, is that correct?


[09/09/2023 22:59] pabloeksdi
Why is there maxDeposit and maxMint and why does it increase when an order gets fulfilled?


[09/09/2023 23:06] stoxophone
There is support for EVM to EVM transfers (See here: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-centrifuge/blob/main/src/PoolManager.sol#L149) but it uses Centrifuge as a middle man still. So no direct EVM to EVM communication

[09/10/2023 08:15] hieronx
Launching a pool requires a governance vote by CFG holders on Centrifuge. See https://gov.centrifuge.io/t/rfc-pop-v2-pool-onboarding-process-version-2/4875 for more details. And for a currency to be added through `addCurrency` in liquidity pools, this also requires a governance vote. So there are restrictions on which currencies can be used and which pools can launch.

There's a RWA pool which can have different tiers of investment based on risk apetite (Tranches) for each of those tranches there may be multiple LPs, so each of those LPs can be assigned a different e.g. stablecoin that it can take, and they all mint Tranch Tokens

What I'm still unsure about is where does the profit come from?


[09/10/2023 08:45] catscanaudit
Is the person putting down the RWA asset as collateral for a loan? And then getting the loan liquidity from these LP's so that when he pays back + interest, the interest is the profit for the users that invest in the LPs?


[09/10/2023 08:54] hieronx
I tried to create a visual example, hopefully this helps.

- 1 pool can have multiple tranches (between 1 and 5, generally)
- These can be deployed as Tranche Tokens (ERC20s) on multiple chains (Ethereum and Avalanche in this example.
- On each chain, there can be multiple currencies (stablecoins) that are allowed to be invested with. Therefore there can be multiple Liquidity Pools linked to 1 Tranche Token.

Let me explain, but I do think it's important to say: this is out of scope for this contest, it shouldn't be required to understand this. Ultimately, from the Liquidity Pools perspective, you need to trust Centrifuge that it calculates the tranche token prices correctly, and this is what leads to profit for investors.

But, how it works in practice is that each RWA pool is made up of multiple loans, taken out using NFTs as collateral. These NFTs represent real world assets, e.g. mortgages. The borrower will take out stablecoins from the pool, and off-ramp this to the real world. Later, they will on-ramp back to DeFi, and repay the loan, with interest. This interest is indeed what leads to increase of tranche token prices and therefore profit for the investors.

When a user requestDeposit() of 100 mets say DAI into pool, centrifuge mints 80 TT at price 1.25 . What does this means exactly.
what's the 1.25 price ? As per my understanding it accounts for 1 TT = 1.25 DAI .
This price is set by pool issuer ?

as i understand that native currency and tranches token should have same decimals number right ?


[09/10/2023 13:37] pacelliv
i understood they don't have to, but they are normalized to the same decimals for the calculations


[09/10/2023 13:37] pacelliv
and then unnormalized to their original number of decimals


[09/10/2023 13:38] 0xkazimm
i think this applied for tranche tokens / invest tokens (usdc for example) !


[09/10/2023 13:41] catscanaudit
LPs have native currency tokens, the tranch token connected to that LP is in the same decimals


[09/10/2023 13:41] catscanaudit
Normalizations for calculations comes from the fact that you can have multiple LPs for the same tranch token


[09/10/2023 13:42] catscanaudit
and if the different LPs have tokens with different decimals, normalization is needed for accurate calculations


[09/10/2023 13:43] catscanaudit
Still, tokens with more than 18 decimals are not allowed for LPs


[09/10/2023 13:43] catscanaudit
So only 18 and less

Do we have access to the code that sends commands  from Centrefuge chain, or more exactly from which contract are these comands sent?


[09/11/2023 07:48] 0x3b
Because I can see how the messages are send from Centrefuge, however there is no contract that call `formatExecutedCollectInvest` for example.
So does that mean that calls (like `formatExecutedCollectInvest`) from Centrefuge are expected to be trusted / 100% accurate?


[09/11/2023 08:14] hieronx
> when are users supposed to be set as members before being able to deposit into the protocol and who does it?
This should be triggered by the pool issuer, on Centrifuge Chain. So the pool issuer will verify the investor has signed the agreements and has passed KYC etc, and then will call `update_member` on Centrifuge Chain, which will send the `UpdateMember` message to liquidity pools.

Yes Centrifuge Chain is fully trusted from the perspective of liquidity pools.

Yeah that's maybe a bit misleading. But if you can find a way to somehow change the `maxDeposit/maxMint` values to different ones that are passed from Centrifuge ,that would ultimately still manipulate the price that the deposit/mint is executed at.

The investor use `deposit` to invest currency in a LP, and `mint` transfer tranche tokens to the investor from the Escrow contract.


[09/11/2023 17:22] hieronx
That's not exactly right unfortunately. `requestDeposit` is used to submit a deposit order and trasnfer currency.

Later, either `deposit` or `mint` can be used to claim tranche tokens, after the deposit request was executed. The difference is that with `deposit`, you specify the value of tranche tokens in currency you want to claim (e.g. the USDC value), while with `mint` you specify the number of tranche tokens you want to claim.

This is to align with the ERC4626 standard.

Good point! This is us being used to writing tests previously with dapptools, and for that you had no `vm.prank`  so this was the only way. We should indeed change this 🙂


[09/11/2023 21:10] nican0r
@hieronx I'm confused about the purpose of the `collectDeposit` and `collectRedeem` in the LiquidityPool contract, it seems like they're submitting a message to the Centrifuge chain but couldn't a user accomplish the same thing without having to wait for execution on Centrifuge using `redeem` or `deposit`? Am I missing something?


[09/11/2023 21:24] hieronx
Yeah understandably, we should have documented this better. In most cases, these functions should never be used by anyone. When a deposit/redeem order is executed on Centrifuge Chain, this should automatically trigger `ExecutedCollect*` messages.

However, in case for some reason this does not happen, these functions are backups, that a user can call to manually trigger collecting the outcome of the executed orders on Centrifuge Chain.

[09/12/2023 06:04] 0x3b
From what I understood there could be multiple tranches per currency. Does that mean that all of the tranches for that currency are gonna return equal ratios, or can they be different?
Ex:
Tranche 1 to USDC => 80%  so for 100USD it will return 80TT
Tranche 2 to USDC => 40%  so for 100USD it will return 40CC


[09/12/2023 06:35] hieronx
Yes that is possible


[09/12/2023 06:37] hieronx
Simple example. A pool with a senior and a junior tranche. Both start at a price of 1.00 USDC.

A year later, senior has accrued a little bit of interest, and is now priced at 1.10 USDC.
But junior has accrued much more profit, and is now priced at 1.50 USDC.

Now if you buy 100 USDC of senior, you get 100/1.1 = ~90 senior tranche tokens
If you buy 100 USDC of junior, you get 100/1.5 = ~66 junior tranche tokens

For a conceptual explanation of tranches:
> Investors often want different kinds of risk exposure and yield on the same asset class. In the traditional finance world, one way to achieve this is by introducing a tiered investment structure or in other words, different tranches. This means that investors can invest in the same group of assets through different classes of debt with different risk/return profiles. A standard example is shown below.
> 
> At its most common form, a pool could have a junior and senior tranche, with the junior tranche tracking the first loss position and receiving the excess yield, while the senior position receives a lower, fixed yield, but is protected from losses by junior. A key advantage of this structure is that it allows the issuer of the pool to invest in the junior tranche and thus take a first loss position in the pool, ensuring skin in the game. Another example includes a three tranche structure, where a super senior lender such as MakerDAO invests in the most senior tranche, other investors invest in a mezzanine tranche, and the pool issuer invests in the junior tranche. Tinlake supports a junior and senior tranche for a pool, whereas Pools on Centrifuge Chain will allow more tranches.

> For each tranche, tokens are issued that investors receive, representing interests in the tranches of the pool. These tokens are considered securities, thus can only be held by and transferred to KYCed accounts. The pool issuer can specify which accounts are allowed to hold which tranche tokens.

Can someone explain what is junior and senior


[09/12/2023 10:06] pabloeksdi
Types of tranches, one can choose to invest in either depending on how much risk he is willing to take. Simply said the senior tranche is less risky but also returns less profit, while the junior tranche is more volatile but that results in greater profits if no defaults happen in that pool. Also the junior tranche covers the mezzanine and senior tranches' losses. You can check them out deeper in the docs

> very noobie question, did fullfilled here mean the tx done successfully ?
The tx itself is just submitting the request. Fulfilled here means the deposit/redeem request was executed and the user will get currency / tranche tokens.

In processRedeem() we are using two arguments receiver and user is both contains have same meaning


[09/12/2023 11:49] hieronx
No, the `user` is the owner of the tranche tokens that were redeemed, and the the `receiver` is the account that will get the currency (stablecions).


[09/12/2023 12:22] 0x3b
Does `updateTrancheTokenPrice` have any effect over the price, from what I can see it only updates the price in **LiquidityPool** where it is **not used** for anything?
Or are there gonna be other DAPs that may query the price from **LiquidityPool**


[09/12/2023 12:24] hieronx
It is used for `convertToAssets` / `totalAssets` / `convertToShares`. Indeed the liquidity pool contracts themselves don't use this , and this is intended to be used by external contracts that require a price.


[09/12/2023 12:24] nican0r
@hieronx the natspec for the  `decreaseDepositRequest` and `decreaseRedeemRequest` says that they perform their respective operations for outstanding orders, does this mean we can assume that the processing of the messages on the Centrifuge chain will cancel these requests if they are trying to submit a request on an order that has already been executed? In other words, they can't be used to decrease the size of a liquidity provider's position, only to decrease a request that hasn't been executed, is that correct?

And because of this there would be no `isExecutedDecreaseX` received by the `Gateway` so basically nothing would happen in the code being audited?


[09/12/2023 12:25] 0x3b
Yes I forgot to mention these, however they are also not used anywhere in the core math, are they just for visualization or have you guys planned something to use  them?

why do you need to be member?


[09/12/2023 13:04] hieronx
Investing in RWA pools requires passing KYC/KYB checks, and being verified by the issuer of the pool. Thus the issuer adds you as a member to the pool before you can invest.

            gateway.cancelRedeemOrder(

Just wanted to clarify since we got a lot of questions about this. For this section of code in the liquidity pool contract:
```
    /// @dev Either msg.sender is the owner or a ward on the contract
    modifier withApproval(address owner) {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "LiquidityPool/no-approval");
        _;
    }
```
The comment is wrong, and the code is correct: this modifier should only check that the `owner` is the `msg.sender`.


[09/13/2023 06:03] hieronx
Also, another common question: there is no built-in fee payments for the Axelar message sending. You can assume this happens automatically, through a bot.

1. current price is 1 : 1 DAI to share
2. you invest 100 DAI for 100 shares

You can transfer tranche tokens to another chain (say from Ethereum to Base), if you want. It just goes through Centrifuge so the bookkeeping of which chain holds how many tranche tokens can be updated.

The purpose of transfer is just transferring stablecoins to and from Centrifuge Chain.

The idea behind the code was normal to understand and i can say it was 5-6 difficulty but, the difficulty to find some vuln is 8-9 as its very well written codebase and a bit complex function calls.


[09/13/2023 14:50] 0xkazimm
Thank you 🙏🏻


[09/13/2023 14:52] secoalba
This is my 4th contest analysed and I have spent less than 4 days (3-4 h) per day and I have only been able to find 3 (apparently) medium category errors.

I still have a lot of room for improvement.
How did you find it?


[09/13/2023 14:54] j4x_98
Same here, it took me a pretty short time to understand the code, but a pretty long timeframe and a lot of testcases that failed until i found something interesting

[09/13/2023 14:55] j4x_98
I find/found it super interesting but it took me a long time until i found something interesting 🙂 Also the functions get more complex the more it goes down the control flow imo


[09/13/2023 15:25] mert_eren#2527
is there any documentation for how prices will be determined of tranches


[09/13/2023 15:25] minh___
Why is the root contract a ward on other contracts if it cant call any functions? Is it just to make "linking" the contracts easier during deployment through `relyContract` and `denyContract` or am I missing something obvious here?


[09/13/2023 15:26] mert_eren#2527
and is latestPrice variant of liqudity pool important


[09/13/2023 15:26] minh___
has been answered above somewhere: you dont need to understand it for this audit, but you can by checking out-of-scope code

[09/13/2023 15:40] gr34t.l4k3#1626
seem like root contract can set timelock too :)), it's used as a protection

> You can use relyContract to make an EOA or Contract a ward in any contract root is a ward of, effectivelly being able to call any function you want in the target contract (edit: award -> ward :P) 
Yes exactly. In practice this will just be migrations contracts, like the spell pattern from maker https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/governance-module/spell-detailed-documentation

In DelayedAdmin.sol only auth can pause the transaction, but in PauseAdmin.sol the others that auth gave the permission can pause the transaction.
However, their ward cant be 1.  Is it expected performance?

A High, lets see how it goes.


[09/14/2023 13:35] nmirchev8
```
  assets = shares.mulDiv(
            LiquidityPoolLike(liquidityPool).latestPrice(),
            10 ** (PRICE_DECIMALS + trancheTokenDecimals - currencyDecimals),
            MathLib.Rounding.Down
        );
```
Why we do (PRICE_DEC + trancheDecimals - currencyDecimals)?


[09/14/2023 13:36] j4x_98
This is done to normalize the decimals of each token to the PRICE_DECIMALS (10**18) which makes calculation easier

Hi @J4X please explain about this.


[09/14/2023 13:51] j4x_98
I'm also not a sponsor of this contest. I also struggled with the image a bit. I think it explains how liquidity is managed between the EVM chains and the CFG chain. I at least didn't need it for my review. I just assumed that Bridging is possible, and that the USDC in the escrow get wrapped and can then be used on CFG chain by the issuer of the pool


[09/14/2023 13:52] j4x_98
But I think there was some more detailed explanation of it by the sponsor further up in the chat

Users can cancel request when its in the epoch that the request is called at, for example:
Call request order —> in order list in epoch 1 —-cancel or decrease before epoch 2 —> reached epoch 2 so the order can not be cancel or decrease

Huge thanks to everyone for participating in the contest, from @Stoxophone @ilinz and myself!

It's been a really nice experience watching everyone dive into different parts of the codebase. I'm really impressed by how deep of an understanding some wardens got in the last few days.

We're looking forward to seeing all of the findings 🙂

Thanks to the sponsors for hosting this contest, you guys really did a great job with your codebase, I'd like to emphasize that I love the initiative taken by @hieronx of creating a group with all the sponsors, that was a really cool experience, I needed to ask the question one time and any of the sponsors who saw the question first would answer it 🫡

When will the report ready for audit? I want to see the findings. The codebase was well written 🙂


[09/15/2023 06:15] t1moh
Get ready to wait several months


[09/15/2023 06:45] 0xdalla
why several months ? is it because the axelar also took quite some time (actually still not out) ?


[09/15/2023 06:47] t1moh
Check the statistics, check which projects are now in "reporting" stage


[09/15/2023 06:51] 0xdalla
Oh right there was chainlink not long ago there is quite some judging to do indeed


[09/15/2023 07:38] mrudenko
Avg time is 30-40 days


[09/15/2023 07:39] mrudenko
But it depends on count of submitted issues


[09/15/2023 13:13] uncle Jeff#4407
where can I check this?


[09/15/2023 15:14] t1moh
There is no such a place, C4 Rollup message in Announcements contains which projects are on Reporting stage. And there are old projects on this stage like Popcorn

nope, all good


[09/17/2023 21:34] 0xkazimm
you should wait till QA peroid as  i know if you have backstage rule then you can ask judges about it.


[09/18/2023 00:05] kaveyjoe
Judging from judge isn't started yet  and you have no right to discuss your finding outside anywhere until Report is published, if you  have any question Regarding this  , you can direct ask to judge during Post QA peroid.

it could be a mistake


[09/18/2023 07:14] lourenslinde
Hi friend, this is a very recent contest so what you're probably seeing is the pre-sort from the lookout that tags your issue as a duplicate of another and then closes it. This doesn't mean it's invalid (only that it is a duplicate). 

Also, bear in mind that comments and questions about findings should not be done publicly (even in this channel). Questions about judgments can be raised during the Post-Judging QA period which will be announced in the backstage channel :gummy_bear:

According to the number of findings on the profile page of both wardens (1 medium solo), the reward distribution is not correct.
There is a problem with calculations or the profile page has a bug.

8 medium findings and 49300$ -> ~6000$ per finding
Duo to the 2nd warden profile @alexfilippov314 has only 1 medium (solo).
I think profile page has bug​🤔


[10/02/2023 17:38] eme0242
that's not how reward calculation works


[10/02/2023 17:40] visualbits
Yes, but maximum reward per finding doesn't exceeds ~6500$ for 8 findings
`Total H/M reward / 8`


[10/02/2023 17:42] 0xstalin
The more dups a finding has, the less worth it, the value lost by the duplicates goes to the more rare findings

52  medium findings have dublicates and 8 are unique, right?


[10/02/2023 17:44] 0xstalin
Example, if pot is 10k, and there are 2 valid findings, but one of the two got duplicates and the other is unique, the pot of the valid with dups won’t be 5k split among all those who find it, the pot will be less than 5k, and the other unique will be worth more than 5k

This was my first contest


[10/02/2023 18:04] uncle Jeff#4407
it is not, but sometimes the bug won't be feasible so u have to write a PoC to check its validity

check for a transaction to your address here https://polygonscan.com/ and if there is one, just import USDC to your polygon metamask

Reward was Already sent and Instantly moved from your wallet to another wallet  (0xd1... to 0x57...)


[10/03/2023 19:40] 7a4raf

How can I know if my analysis report is accepted or not?

Hi friend, your wallet is likely compromised (hacked) and is being drained by a bot that monitors it for any incoming funds.

Hey, I noticed that the report is out. Now we can discuss about the findings right👀 ? More specifically, I want to learn why one of my issue was deemed invalid:gummy_wink: .

This is the issue [633](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-centrifuge-findings/issues/633) can anyone help me understand why this was invalid😄 .

Hats off 🫡 to Centrifuge sponsors and C4 Judges who judged it.    
One month hasn't passed yet when it was submitted , results and report both are out.

Hi, how can I see my findings in centrifuge? The report is out

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-centrifuge-findings/tree/main/data  - look for .json files with your username. They contain links to your issues

Ok thanks

Have a question about this finding: https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-centrifuge-findings/issues/553

It was marked as duplicate of https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-centrifuge-findings/issues/78 but they are imo completely different issues.

I couldn't find comments about why 553 and other findings similar to it were invalidated though.  Anybody know why findings similar to 553 (but not 78) were invalid?


[10/13/2023 15:08] bowtiedvirus
Maybe it makes sense that it was invalidated because it was due to user mistake?

Thanks for the link. Fwiw, if I had backstage, I think I might have escalated on this. All good though. 😎
